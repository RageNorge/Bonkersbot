# bonkersbot
Welcome to the domain of bonkersbot!

This bot was made as a small little project based off weaselbot made by weabot.

Lots of thanks to weabot for doing pretty much all the work for me!

#Phrases

The bot will sometimes reply to specific phrases!

Some of these (not all you shouldn't try finding out, you will find them at last don't get banned) are:

ayy - replies "lmao"

good bonkersbot - replies "danks m89"

bad bonkersbot - replies "u fukin wot m8, i'll rek you on wii party"

cheese - replies "sometimes, I dream about cheese..."

There is a couple more, but those you will have to find on your own! Good luck! :)

#Commands
These tell the bot what to do in a simple way.

All commands under this start with '.'

gitbonkers - sounds like getbonkers if you say it out loud, this command takes you to this repo!

purpose - tells you bonkersbot's purpose.

creator - tells you who created this magnificent bot.

meme - gives a link to a dank maymay.

That's really it at this point. Thanks for checking out bonkersbot! :)
